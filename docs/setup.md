# Configuration

For optimal performance of the **OT - Vulnerability Management** solution pack, install and configure the following connectors:

- **NIST National Vulnerability Database** connector to get Known Exploited Vulnerabilities(KEV) CVEs. To configure and use the NIST National Vulnerability Database connector, refer to [Configuring NIST National Vulnerability Database](https://docs.fortinet.com/fortisoar/connectors/nist-nvd)

- **Code Snippet** connector to execute python code. To configure and use the Code Snippet connector, refer to [Configuring Code Snippet](https://docs.fortinet.com/fortisoar/connectors/codesnippet-new)

- **CISA Advisory** connector to get Advisory and Known Exploited Vulnerability (KEV) CVE. A default configuration &ndash; OT Vulnerability Management Default &ndash; ships with the CISA Advisory connector.

    <th><strong>NOTE</strong></th>
    <td>You may choose to create a new configuration by following <a href="https://docs.fortinet.com/fortisoar/connectors/cisaadvisory">CISA Advisory connector document</a>; however, note that associated playbooks would require changes to accommodate the new configuration. For more information on making changes to the associated playbooks, refer <a href="./configuring-ingestion-playbooks.md">Configuring Ingestion Playbooks for Custom Configuration</a>.</td>
