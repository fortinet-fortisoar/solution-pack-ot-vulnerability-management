# Usage

Refer to [Simulate Scenario documentation](https://github.com/fortinet-fortisoar/solution-pack-soc-simulator/blob/develop/docs/usage.md) to understand how to simulate and reset scenarios.

To understand the process FortiSOAR follows to manage vulnerabilities in Operational Technology (OT), we have included a simulation mode. It provides a solution for handling the Known Exploited Vulnerability (KEV) CVEs under ICS Advisories . We have included a scenario &mdash; **OT - Known Exploit Vulnerability (KVE) Alert Raised For Asset At Risk** with this solution pack.

Refer to the section **OT - Vulnerability Management** to understand how this solution pack automation addresses your needs.

## Simulation mode

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>NOTE</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>
            Before using the simulation mode, make the following changes:
            <ol>
                <li>To get latest report of listed CVEs, configure the <strong><em>NIST National Vulnerability Database</em></strong> connector.</li>
                <li>Set global variable <code>Demo_mode</code> to <em><code>true</code></em>. Refer to the section <a href="https://docs.fortinet.com/document/fortisoar/7.4.3/playbooks-guide/488685/dynamic-values#Global_Variables">Global Variables</a> in the <strong>Playbooks Guide</strong> of the platform documentation for more information.</li>
            </ol>
        </td>
    </tr>

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>NOTE</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>
            <ol>
                <li>Mark <strong>Does Patch Exist?</strong> as <strong><em>Unknown</em></strong> before resetting the scenario.</li>
                <li>Reset the scenario before moving to <strong>Production Mode</strong>.</li>
            </ol>
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>

## Production Mode

1. Set global variable `Demo_mode` to *`false`*. Refer to the section [Global Variables](https://docs.fortinet.com/document/fortisoar/7.4.3/playbooks-guide/488685/dynamic-values#Global_Variables) in the **Playbooks Guide** of the platform documentation for more information.</li>

2. In **02 - Use Case - ICS Advisory and CVEs** and **02 - Use Case - KEV Alert** playbook collections, select and mark all the playbooks as **_Active_**.

3. Ingest Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) CVEs published by *Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA)* using any of the following methods:

    - Activate the schedule **Ingest Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) CVEs** to periodically ingest data.
    
        Alternatively, you can activate and trigger the schedule to initiate ingestion immediately.

    - Execute **Ingest Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) CVEs** from **Vulnerability Management** > **CVEs** module's list view.

4. Consider the following when ingesting advisories:

    - To get ICS Advisory execute the playbook **Ingest CISA ICS Advisory** available as a button in **OT Vulnerability Management** > **ICS Advisories**.
        - Alternatively, you can activate the schedule **Ingest CISA ICS Advisory** to initiate ingestion periodically.

    - To get ICS Medical Advisory, execute the playbook **Ingest CISA ICS Medical Advisory** available as a button in **OT Vulnerability Management** > **ICS Advisories**.
        - Alternatively, you can activate the schedule **Ingest CISA ICS Medical Advisory** to initiate ingestion periodically.

    - Assets are correlated with ICS Advisories if the asset is found for the same vendor and product as that of the ICS Advisory.

5. A *KEV alert* is created only when the following conditions are met:

    - The CVE listed in **OT - Vulnerability Management** > **ICS advisories** is found in [CISA KEV catalog](https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog).

    - The associated asset is present in the FortiSOAR&trade; environment.

6. Alternatively, you can create a KEV alert by triggering the **Create KEV Alert** playbook.

    This playbook becomes available on selection of ICS advisories &mdash; under **OT - Vulnerability Management** > **ICS advisories** &mdash; that have been marked *Yes* under **Is In KEV**.

7. Assigned person gets In-App and email notifications on creation of a **KEV alert**.

## KEV Alert SLA Notifications in Accordance with BOD 22-01

To receive SLA reminders and SLA breach notifications, in Accordance with guidelines laid down by [BOD 22-01](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/directives/bod-22-01-reducing-significant-risk-known-exploited-vulnerabilities), make following changes:

1. Edit the **BOD 22-01 - Notify KEV Alert Report** playbook under the **02 - Use Case - KEV Alert** playbook collection.

2. Edit the **Configuration** playbook step.

3. Specify days remaining in SLA breach in the variable `reminderDayList`. Enter values as a list. For example `[90, 30, 15, 13, 7, 2, 1, 0]`.

4. Specify email addresses to notify in the variable `sendTo`. Enter values as a list and enclose email address with quotes (`" "`). For example `["user1@mail.example.com", "user2@mail.example.com"]`.

    ![Editing BOD 22-01 - Notify KEV Alert Report playbook](./res/edit_BOD_22-01_notify_kev_alert_report.png)

5. Activate the schedule **BOD 22-01: Notify KEV Alert Summary Report** to receive notification emails as per the schedule frequency for each KEV alert.

    - Notification emails are sent to users as per the schedule frequency; however, the KEV Alert Summary report is attached only when the SLA remaining, as per the KEV alert, and values in `reminderDayList`, match.
